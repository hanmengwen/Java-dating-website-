In today's society, young people's friendship needs promote the development of the Internet industry in the field of marriage and dating. 
However, it is difficult to retain users in the online dating platform on the market nowadays. 
The main reason is that it does not provide users with the services they really want, and does not directly present the information users really want in a clear, 
clear, simple and understandable way. Right now. On this basis, this dating platform has done a lot of research and investigation, 
inspected a large number of known dating platforms on the market, created the most needed functions for users, committed to providing the most perfect, 
thoughtful and meticulous services. Marriage and dating platform is based on B/S mode, using Java and JavaScript language to develop, 
and using the most advanced websocket technology to manage the chat room, using TOMCAT server, using Navicat to manage and store the database.
The system includes user module, whisper module, administrator module and chat room module.
The system can not only provide users with a platform to show themselves, but also provide users with a way to understand others, 
which greatly facilitates the user's friendship experience.
